# About Project
This is a computer vision project with the task to segment classes within image or video. The object / class to be segmented is relevant to the instances that will occured in real case of self driving car application.

The objective of this project is to:
1. Exploring different architectural of neural network model for segmentations.
2. Try to re-train or finetuning the models with or without existing pretrained model/weight.
The dataset used and class label are from small collection of Cityscape Dataset  
3. Implement simple inference with different inputs:
- Image (Link, Upload)
- Static / File Video (Link, Upload)
- Video Stream (Live Webcam)
